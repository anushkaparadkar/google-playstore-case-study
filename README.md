# Google Play Store Case Study
## Problem Statement:
 The team at Google Play Store wants to develop a feature that would enable them to boost visibility for the most promising apps. Now, this analysis would require a   preliminary understanding of the features that define a well-performing app. You can ask questions like:
  -- Does a higher size or price necessarily mean that an app would perform better than the other apps? 
  -- Or does a higher number of installs give a clear picture of which app would have a better rating than others?
